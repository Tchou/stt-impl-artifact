     Hash table specialized for computations over co-inductive structures.

      This table can be used for computations over co-inductive structures whose
      results depend on an initial guess. When exploring a co-inductive value
       [v : V.t], we say that [v] is [Active], if it is being explored and the
      exploration is not finished. The API is as follows:
     - first, one looks for [v] in the table, using [find ~default:r table v]

     - if [v] is not in the table, it associates an initial result [r : R.t],
            returns [None] and [v] becomes active. The exploration of
            [v] can continue.
     - if [v] is in the table, it means it is encountered again. The initial
            value stored is returned as [Some r] and all values that became
            active after [v] and are still active are recorded. 
            These are the dependencies of [v].

     - when returning from the initial exploration of [v] with a computed
        result [r'], one needs to update the result [update table v r']:
     - if [R.equal r r'] then the initial guess was correct, and all
              dependencies are left as-is
     - otherwise, the dependencies of [v] are removed from the table: they
              were computed while making the (wrong) hypothesis that the result for
              [v] was [r], while it is [r']. Later calls to [find ~default:r table
              v] will return [r'] unless it is itself invalidated.
